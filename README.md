### Steps to Install the software on your own computer (not supported by course staff)

 If you prefer to manage your own software, you also have the option to install R and RStudio on your own computer. This involves _two steps_:
  - First, install R based on your operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux) here: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).
  - Next, download RStudio (RStudio Desktop Free version): [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
